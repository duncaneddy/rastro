It is designed to be high performance, easy to learn, and fast to code, and ready for flight. The key features are: Intuitive : API designed to be easily composable, making it easy to solve complex problems correctly by building on core functionality. Easy to Learn : Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading papers, more time building. Fast to code : Rastro provides a Python 3.6+ wrapper that is auto-generated from the core rust libraries. Making it easy to use without compromising performance. Fast to run : Very high performance, on par with C++ libraries, thanks to core library being written in Rust. RAstro gets its name from the combination of Rust and astrodynamics (Rust + astro = RAstro). Space dynamics is an expansive field that covers multiple domains of mathematics, astrodynamics, attitude dynamics, and systems engineering. While the underlying concepts have been studied and known since Kepler wrote down his three laws, there are few modern software libraries that make these concepts easily accessible. Space dynamics software generally runs into the following pitfalls: It is usually expensive, commercially licensed software making it inaccessible for students, hobby projects, or new endeavours. They are heritage libraries making integration with modern tools challenging They are heritage APIs, while extremely well tested, also have an extremely steep learning curve. Additionally, the closed-source nature makes it difficult, if not impossible, to understand the true algorithmic implementation. This can make root-causing issues and learning from the software prohibitive. Due to these challenges, students, researchers, and engineers frequently end up reimplementing common astrodynamics functions with an unfortunately frequent regularity. While reimplementation of common code can be a good learning mechanisms, in most cases it is both error-prone and costs time better spent on other endeavours. This project seeks to address this challenge by providing an easy-to-use, well-tested library, built in Rust for performance with bindings to Python for ease of use. This project builds on experience from past projects in building space dynamics software: - brahe A pure-python astrodynamics library - SatelliteDynamics.jl A Julia astrodynamics library Documentation \u00b6 You can find the package documentation here . This documentation is meant to provide a human-friendly walkthrough of the software and package. RAstro is currently in the early stages of development so the documentation will likely not be complete. Sections marked [WIP] will have some software functionality implemented but not be considered documented. The most complete API reference guide will always be the Rust crate API reference, found [TODO]. This is always up-to-date with the latest release since it is autogenerated at build time during the release process. Software Usage and License \u00b6 The RAstro package is licensed and distributed under an MIT License to encourage adoption and to make it easy to integrate with other tools. The only thing asked is that if you do use the package in your work, or appreciate the project, either send a message or star the project. Knowing that the project is being actively used is a large motivator for continued development. Support and Acknowledgement \u00b6 RAstro is currently being developed primarily for my own enjoyment and because I find having these tools helpful in professional work. I plan to continue developing it for the time being regardless of greater adoption, time permitting. That being said, it's incredibly encouraging and useful to know if the software is being adopted or found useful in wider practice. If you're using RAstro for school, research, or a commercial endeavour, I'd love to know about it! Tweet me @duncaneddy or email me at duncan.eddy (at) gmail.com.

Like RAstro, each section builds on previous ones but are each treated as separate topics allowing you to go directly to any specific topic or application of interest. This section is meant to provide a practical walk through of the library. Validation A Validation section provides information on the validation and verification steps used to provide indepdent confirmation of the correctness of the RAstro library implementation. Library Architecture \u00b6 Any astrodynamics library is a complex system that has to balance software implementation considerations with the underlying scientific models. RAstro is built based off of an astrodynamics-first principle with the belief that the software architecture should reflect the development of physics-based concepts at play. It is hoped that it will be easier for new users to navigate and learn software by logically grouping the software with respect to similar concepts taught in books and in schools. This enables users to apply their physics-based intuition in understanding the software.

Includes both conservative and non-conservative forces. tle Functions for handling Two-Line Elements and associate SGP propagators. attitude Object orientation representation. propagators Implementation of specific dynamics propagators relative_motion Orbit and coordinate transforms for representation and analysis of satellite relative motion math Mathematical support functions including numerical integrators used for propagation. Design Tenets \u00b6 RAstro has a few design tenets that have guided the implementation to improve overall usability and safety. Safety in this case means that the user should be protected from using models incorrectly and from making unintentional assumptions based on internal implementation details. The first such tenet is that all parameter values and function specifications of RAstro assume that the inputs and outputs are in SI base units . This is made so that at no point does the user have to check if inputs or outputs are of the right type. This allows for functions and parameters of RAstro to be directly composable. The second tenet is that the default values for frequent operations and functions should be chosen to be consistent with the most common use cases as well as with the highest fidelity models possible. Users should not have to spend significant effort to build accurate, high-fidelity models. That work should be provided by the library whenever possible. The third tenet is that it is better to be explicit rather than implicit whenever possible. This ensures that the user must make conscious decisions about which parameter values to use, which functions to call. This tenet is sometimes in conflict with the second and in these cases the second tenent of usability is the preferred option with implementation assumptions captured in documentation and in code.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"user_guide/#introduction","text":"This user guide shows you how to use RAstro with a walk through of its modules, step by step.

Earth Orientation Parameters are empirically observed, estimated parameters that describe the irregularities in Earth's rotation in space. When combined with their specific related models they provide the mechanism to transform between an Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) reference frame and an inertial reference frame. IERS \u00b6 The International Earth Rotation Service (IERS) was established in 1987 by the International Astronomical Union and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. The IERS provides data on Earth orientation, on the International Celestial Reference System/Frame, and on the International Terrestrial Reference System/Frame. The IERS also maintains conventions containing models, constants and standards used for modeling Earth orientation. The IERS deals with reference systems and reference frames . A reference system is an idealized mathematical concept for defining a reference used to represent the state of objects in that system. The two primary reference systems developed by the IERS are the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) and International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS). A reference system is a concept and cannot be used directly, therefore the IERS develops reference frames , which are specific realizations of a given reference system. A reference frame realization defines the models, standards, and associated data products for users to actually interact and use that reference system. The primary reference frames of the IERS are the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). The ICRS and ITRS models are defined with respect to the solar system barycenter 1 . However, for many satellite-specific engineering applications we are primarily concerned with geocentric references, centered at Earth. Therefore, RAstro primarily deals with the Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame (GCRF) and Geocentric Terrestrial Reference Frame (GTRF). For most intents and purposes the international and geocentric references are identical as there is no rotation component between ICRS and GCRS (or ITRF and GCRF) 2 . The transformation between the two reference systems and frames is simply a pure translation. For a more detailed discussion of reference frames and systems please read IERS Technical Note 36 provides an in-depth discussion of the concepts presented and discussed here. Earth Orientation Products \u00b6 The IERS provides various Earth orientation products which are derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) or a network of terrestrial GPS 3 reference stations. The continual observations made by these stations are combined with specific reference frame realizations (e.g. the IAU 2010 conventions) to model Earth orientation and enable the transformation between inertial and Earth-fixed reference frames. The Earth orientation parameter products come in multiple variations, all of which can be found at the IERS data products site . These variations arise from the selection of precession-nutation model, ITRF realization, the data sources, and data processing time span. There are two precession-nutation models widely in use today: IAU 1980 nutation theory and the IAU2006/2000A precession-nutation model. The ITRF 2014 realization is the most recent realization and preferred in most cases. For data products there are two primary distinctions: standard products and long term products. Standard products, which are produced daily, to provide a daily estimate of the past Earth orientation along with forward-looking predictions available for use in planning. Long term data products are only available for past days, and are produced less frequently, but provider higher accurate estimates of Earth orientation. For most purposes the standard products provide sufficient accuracy along with the benefit of having fairly accurate forward-looking predictions. Therefore, RAstro defaults to using standard Earth Orientation data products wherever possible. Unless otherwise stated or specified, RAstro uses IERS standard product generated with respect to IAU 2006/2000A precession-nutation model and consistent with ITRF2014. Earth Orientation Parameters \u00b6 Rastro provides the EarthOrientationData object to handle loading, storing, and providing Earth orientation data for use. The package also includes default data files for ease of use that are sufficient for most purposes. Loading Data Data Sets \u00b6 Earth orientation data is loaded by creating an instance of an EarthOrientationData object with from the desired data source. There are four methods that can be used: from_default_standard , from_c04_file , from_default_standard , and from_standard_file . The from_default_standard and from_c04_file methods will load long-term IERS C04 products and expect to be passed such as an input. Similarly, from_default_standard and from_standard_file can be used to load either Bulletin A or Bulletin B data from the IERS standard file product format. When creating any new Earth Orientation data instance there are two parameters that are set at loading time which will determine how the EOP instances handles data returns for certain cases. The first parameter is the extrapolate parameter, which can have a value of Zero , Hold , or Error . This value will determine how requests for data points beyond the end of the loaded data are handled. The possible behaviors are - Zero : Returned values will be 0.0 where data is not available - Hold : Will return the last available returned value when data is not available - Error : Data access attempts where data is not present will panic and terminate the program The second parameter the the interpolate setting. When interpolate is set to true and data requests made for a point that wasn't explicitly loaded as part of the input data set will be linearly interpolated to the desired time. When set to false , the function call will return the last value prior to the requested data. Below is an example of loading C04 data Rust Python use rastro :: eop :: { EarthOrientationData , EOPExtrapolation }; fn main () { // Example 1: Load Default C04 File with extrapolation // EOPExtrapolation is a enum that sets the extrapolation mode. It has possible values of: // - EOPExtrapolation::Hold // - EOPExtrapolation::Zero // - EOPExtrapolation::Error // // The Interpolation mode here is set as `true` let eop = EarthOrientationData :: from_default_c04 ( EOPExtrapolation :: Hold , true ); // Last ut1_utc offset stored in table. // eop.mjd_max is the maximum MJD date of data loaded in the table. let last_ut1_utc = eop . get_ut1_utc ( eop . mjd_max . into ()); // Get UT1_UTC value that is well beyond the end of the loaded data let hold_ut1_utc = eop . get_ut1_utc ( 9999999.9 ); // Confirm that the EOP provider extrapolated beyond the end of the table by holding the value assert! ( last_ut1_utc == hold_ut1_utc ); // Example 2: Load Default C04 data with \"Zero\" extrapolation value let eop = EarthOrientationData :: from_default_c04 ( EOPExtrapolation :: Zero , true ); // Confirm that values beyond the end of table are zero assert!

However, when loading standard files there is one other parameter which comes into play, the Earth Orientation Type. This type setting determines whether the Bulletin A or Bulletin B data is loaded into the object when parsing the file. In rust Rust Python use rastro :: eop :: { EarthOrientationData , EOPExtrapolation , EOPType }; fn main () { // Example 1: Load Default C04 File with extrapolation // EOPExtrapolation is a enum that sets the extrapolation mode. It has possible values of: // - EOPExtrapolation::Hold // - EOPExtrapolation::Zero // - EOPExtrapolation::Error // // The Interpolation mode here is set as `true` // // EOPType is an enum that sets indicates which type of Earth Orientation to load from a file. // It is also a property of all EarthOrientationData objects that provides what type of data // was loaded into the object.

( last_ut1_utc == hold_ut1_utc ); // Example 2: Load Default C04 data with \"Zero\" extrapolation value let eop = EarthOrientationData :: from_default_standard ( EOPExtrapolation :: Zero , true , EOPType :: StandardBulletinB ); // Confirm that values beyond the end of table are zero assert!

For analysis for scenarios in the past it is recommended to use the final C04 products as they contain the highest accress estimates of Earth orientation data. Accessing Earth Orientation Data \u00b6 Most of the time the data stored by the Earth orientation object is not used directly, instead the object is passed to others that will make the appropraite access calls. If your application calls for accessing The EarthOrientationData object provides a number of methods for accessing different Earth orientation Parameters stored by the object. Rust Python use rastro :: eop :: { EarthOrientationData , EOPExtrapolation , EOPType }; #[allow(non_snake_case)] #[allow(unused)] fn main () { // Load Default C04 File with extrapolation let eop = EarthOrientationData :: from_default_standard ( EOPExtrapolation :: Hold , true , EOPType :: StandardBulletinA ); // Get UT1-UTC off set for a given MJD.

The discontinuous jumps are when leap seconds were introduced. window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: 'local'}; window.PLOTLYENV=window.PLOTLYENV || {}; if

The IERS provides data on Earth orientation, on the International Celestial Reference System/Frame, and on the International Terrestrial Reference System/Frame. The IERS also maintains conventions containing models, constants and standards used for modeling Earth orientation. The IERS deals with reference systems and reference frames . A reference system is an idealized mathematical concept for defining a reference used to represent the state of objects in that system. The two primary reference systems developed by the IERS are the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) and International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS). A reference system is a concept and cannot be used directly, therefore the IERS develops reference frames , which are specific realizations of a given reference system. A reference frame realization defines the models, standards, and associated data products for users to actually interact and use that reference system. The primary reference frames of the IERS are the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) and International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). The ICRS and ITRS models are defined with respect to the solar system barycenter 1 . However, for many satellite-specific engineering applications we are primarily concerned with geocentric references, centered at Earth. Therefore, RAstro primarily deals with the Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame (GCRF) and Geocentric Terrestrial Reference Frame (GTRF). For most intents and purposes the international and geocentric references are identical as there is no rotation component between ICRS and GCRS (or ITRF and GCRF) 2 . The transformation between the two reference systems and frames is simply a pure translation. For a more detailed discussion of reference frames and systems please read IERS Technical Note 36 provides an in-depth discussion of the concepts presented and discussed here.","title":"IERS"},{"location":"user_guide/data/eop/#earth-orientation-products","text":"The IERS provides various Earth orientation products which are derived from Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) or a network of terrestrial GPS 3 reference stations. The continual observations made by these stations are combined with specific reference frame realizations (e.g. the IAU 2010 conventions) to model Earth orientation and enable the transformation between inertial and Earth-fixed reference frames. The Earth orientation parameter products come in multiple variations, all of which can be found at the IERS data products site . These variations arise from the selection of precession-nutation model, ITRF realization, the data sources, and data processing time span. There are two precession-nutation models widely in use today: IAU 1980 nutation theory and the IAU2006/2000A precession-nutation model. The ITRF 2014 realization is the most recent realization and preferred in most cases. For data products there are two primary distinctions: standard products and long term products. Standard products, which are produced daily, to provide a daily estimate of the past Earth orientation along with forward-looking predictions available for use in planning. Long term data products are only available for past days, and are produced less frequently, but provider higher accurate estimates of Earth orientation. For most purposes the standard products provide sufficient accuracy along with the benefit of having fairly accurate forward-looking predictions. Therefore, RAstro defaults to using standard Earth Orientation data products wherever possible. Unless otherwise stated or specified, RAstro uses IERS standard product generated with respect to IAU 2006/2000A precession-nutation model and consistent with ITRF2014.","title":"Earth Orientation Products"},{"location":"user_guide/data/eop/#earth-orientation-parameters","text":"Rastro provides the EarthOrientationData object to handle loading, storing, and providing Earth orientation data for use.

There are four methods that can be used: from_default_standard , from_c04_file , from_default_standard , and from_standard_file . The from_default_standard and from_c04_file methods will load long-term IERS C04 products and expect to be passed such as an input. Similarly, from_default_standard and from_standard_file can be used to load either Bulletin A or Bulletin B data from the IERS standard file product format. When creating any new Earth Orientation data instance there are two parameters that are set at loading time which will determine how the EOP instances handles data returns for certain cases. The first parameter is the extrapolate parameter, which can have a value of Zero , Hold , or Error . This value will determine how requests for data points beyond the end of the loaded data are handled. The possible behaviors are - Zero : Returned values will be 0.0 where data is not available - Hold : Will return the last available returned value when data is not available - Error : Data access attempts where data is not present will panic and terminate the program The second parameter the the interpolate setting. When interpolate is set to true and data requests made for a point that wasn't explicitly loaded as part of the input data set will be linearly interpolated to the desired time. When set to false , the function call will return the last value prior to the requested data.

However, when loading standard files there is one other parameter which comes into play, the Earth Orientation Type. This type setting determines whether the Bulletin A or Bulletin B data is loaded into the object when parsing the file.

True anomaly, frequently denoted \\(\\nu\\) , is the angular parameter that defines the position of an object moving along a Keplerian orbit. It is the angle between the eccentricity vector (vector pointing from the main pericenter to the periapsis) and the current position of the body in the orbital plane itself. The eccentric anomaly, \\(E\\) , is another angular parameter that defines the position of an object moving along a Keplerian orbit if viewed from the center of the ellipse. Finally, the mean anomaly, \\(M\\) , defines the fraction of an orbital period that has elapsed since the orbiting object has passed its periapsis. It is the angle from the pericenter an object moving on a fictitious circular orbit with the same semi-major axis would have progressed through in the same time as the body on the true elliptical orbit. Conversion between all types of angular anomaly is possible. However, there is no known direct conversion between true and mean anomaly. Conversion between the two is accomplished by transformation through eccentric anomaly. True and Eccentric Anomaly Conversions \u00b6 To convert from true anomaly to eccentric anomaly, you can use the function anomaly_eccentric_to_true . To perform the reverse conversion use anomaly_true_to_eccentric . Eccentric anomaly can be converted to true anomaly by using equations derived using equations from Vallado 1 . Equation (2-12) $$ \\sin{\\nu} = \\frac{\\sin{E}\\sqrt{1-e^2}}{1 - e\\cos{E}} $$ can be divided by Equation (2-10) $$ \\cos{\\nu} = \\frac{\\cos{E}-e}{1 - e\\cos{E}} $$ And rearranged to get $$ \\nu = \\arctan{\\frac{\\sin{E}\\sqrt{1-e^2}}{\\cos{E}-e}} $$ Which is what is implemented by anomaly_eccentric_to_true . Similarly, Equations (2-9) from Vallado can be rearranged to get $$ E = \\arctan{\\frac{\\sin{\\nu}\\sqrt{1-e^2}}{\\cos{\\nu}+e}} $$ which allows for conversion from true anomaly to eccentric anomaly and is implemented in anomaly_true_to_eccentric .

To perform the reverse conversion use anomaly_mean_to_eccentric . Conversion from eccentric anomaly to mean anomaly is accomplished by application of Kepler's equation $$ M = E - e\\sin{E} $$ which is implemented in anomaly_eccentric_to_mean . Converting back from mean anomaly to eccentric anomaly is more challenging. There is no known closed-form solution to convert from mean anomaly to eccentric anomaly. Instead, we introduce the auxiliary equation $$ f(E) = E - e\\sin(E) - M $$ And treat the problem as numerically solving for the root of \\(f\\) for a given \\(M\\) . This iteration can be accomplished using Newton's method. Starting from an initial guess \\(E_0\\) the value of \\(E_*\\) can be iteratively updated using $$ E_{i+1} = \\frac{f(E_i)}{f^\\prime(E_i)}= E_i - \\frac{E_i - e\\sin{E_i} - M}{1 - e\\cos{E_i}} $$ The algorithm is run until a coverage threshold of $$ |E_{i+1} - E_i| \\leq \\Delta_{\\text{tol}} $$ is reached. The threshold set as 100 times floating-point machine precision 100 * f64::epsilon . This conversion is provided by anomaly_mean_to_eccentric . Warning Because this is a numerical method, convergence is not guaranteed. There is an upper limit of 10 iterations to reach convergence. Since convergence may not occur the output of the function is a Result , forcing the user to explicitly handle the case where the algorithm does not converage. Since Python lacks Rust's same error handling mechanisms, non-convergence will result in a runtime error.

True anomaly, frequently denoted \\(\\nu\\) , is the angular parameter that defines the position of an object moving along a Keplerian orbit. It is the angle between the eccentricity vector (vector pointing from the main pericenter to the periapsis) and the current position of the body in the orbital plane itself. The eccentric anomaly, \\(E\\) , is another angular parameter that defines the position of an object moving along a Keplerian orbit if viewed from the center of the ellipse. Finally, the mean anomaly, \\(M\\) , defines the fraction of an orbital period that has elapsed since the orbiting object has passed its periapsis. It is the angle from the pericenter an object moving on a fictitious circular orbit with the same semi-major axis would have progressed through in the same time as the body on the true elliptical orbit. Conversion between all types of angular anomaly is possible. However, there is no known direct conversion between true and mean anomaly. Conversion between the two is accomplished by transformation through eccentric anomaly.","title":"True, Eccentric, and Mean Anomaly"},{"location":"user_guide/orbits/anomalies/#true-and-eccentric-anomaly-conversions","text":"To convert from true anomaly to eccentric anomaly, you can use the function anomaly_eccentric_to_true . To perform the reverse conversion use anomaly_true_to_eccentric . Eccentric anomaly can be converted to true anomaly by using equations derived using equations from Vallado 1 . Equation (2-12) $$ \\sin{\\nu} = \\frac{\\sin{E}\\sqrt{1-e^2}}{1 - e\\cos{E}} $$ can be divided by Equation (2-10) $$ \\cos{\\nu} = \\frac{\\cos{E}-e}{1 - e\\cos{E}} $$ And rearranged to get $$ \\nu = \\arctan{\\frac{\\sin{E}\\sqrt{1-e^2}}{\\cos{E}-e}} $$ Which is what is implemented by anomaly_eccentric_to_true . Similarly, Equations (2-9) from Vallado can be rearranged to get $$ E = \\arctan{\\frac{\\sin{\\nu}\\sqrt{1-e^2}}{\\cos{\\nu}+e}} $$ which allows for conversion from true anomaly to eccentric anomaly and is implemented in anomaly_true_to_eccentric .

To perform the reverse conversion use anomaly_mean_to_eccentric . Conversion from eccentric anomaly to mean anomaly is accomplished by application of Kepler's equation $$ M = E - e\\sin{E} $$ which is implemented in anomaly_eccentric_to_mean . Converting back from mean anomaly to eccentric anomaly is more challenging. There is no known closed-form solution to convert from mean anomaly to eccentric anomaly. Instead, we introduce the auxiliary equation $$ f(E) = E - e\\sin(E) - M $$ And treat the problem as numerically solving for the root of \\(f\\) for a given \\(M\\) . This iteration can be accomplished using Newton's method. Starting from an initial guess \\(E_0\\) the value of \\(E_*\\) can be iteratively updated using $$ E_{i+1} = \\frac{f(E_i)}{f^\\prime(E_i)}= E_i - \\frac{E_i - e\\sin{E_i} - M}{1 - e\\cos{E_i}} $$ The algorithm is run until a coverage threshold of $$ |E_{i+1} - E_i| \\leq \\Delta_{\\text{tol}} $$ is reached. The threshold set as 100 times floating-point machine precision 100 * f64::epsilon . This conversion is provided by anomaly_mean_to_eccentric . Warning Because this is a numerical method, convergence is not guaranteed. There is an upper limit of 10 iterations to reach convergence. Since convergence may not occur the output of the function is a Result , forcing the user to explicitly handle the case where the algorithm does not converage. Since Python lacks Rust's same error handling mechanisms, non-convergence will result in a runtime error.

Periapsis Properties \u00b6 Two common properties of interest are the distance and velocity of an object at the periapsis of its orbit. The periapsis will be the point of the closest approach as well as the point of greatest speed throughout the orbit. Info The word periapsis is formed by combination of the Greek words \" peri- \", meaning around, about and \" apsis \" meaning \"arch or vault\". An apsis is the farthest or nearest point in the orbit of a planetary body about its primary body. Thereforce periapsis of an orbit is the point of closest approach of the orbiting body with respect to its central body. The suffix can be modified to indicate the point of closest approach to a specific celestical body. The perigee is the point of cloest approach to an object orbiting Earth. The perihelion is the point of closest approach to the Sun. The periapsis velocity is given by periapsis_velocity or, for an Earth-orbiting object, the function perigee_velocity can be used. perigee_velocity simplified the call by supplying the gravitational parameter of Earth to the function call. Periapsis velocity is calculated by $$ v_{p} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{a}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+e}{1-e}} $$ where \\(\\mu\\) is the gravitational constant of the central body, \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and \\(e\\) is the eccentricity.

The apoapsis is the furthest point from the central body. It is also the point of lowest speed throughout the orbit. Info The word apoapsis is formed by combination of the Greek words \" apo- \", meaning away from, separate, or apart from and the word \" apsis \". Thereforce apoapsis of an orbit is the farthest point of an orbiting body with respect to its central body. The suffix can be modified to indicate the farthest point with respect to a specific primary celestical body. The apogee is furthest point away for an object orbiting Earth. The aphelion is the furthest away from an object orbiting the Sun. The apoapsis velocity is given by apoapsis_velocity or, for an Earth-orbiting object, the function apoapsis_velocity can be used. Apoapsis velocity is given by $$ v_{a} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{a}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1-e}{1+e}} $$ The distance of the object to the central body is given by $$ r_a = \\frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e} = a(1+e) $$ Warning The apoapsis position and velocity are valid for elliptic and circular orbits. For parabolic and hyperbolic orbits these two quantities are undefined.

Since for some orbital data exchange formats, an object's orbit is characterized in terms of its mean motion instead of semi-major axis, RAstro provides semimajor_axis and semimajor_axis_general to invert above equation and recover the semi-major axis $$ a = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{\\mu}{n^2}} $$ Orbital Period \u00b6 The orbital period \\(T\\) of a satellite is the time it takes for an orbit to progress through a full revolution. It is given by $$ T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{\\mu}} $$ orbital_period will return the orbital period for an Earth-orbiting object and orbital_period_general will do the same for any arbitrary body for which the gravitational constant is known. The plot below shows how, for a circular orbit, as the semi-major axis increases, the orbital period increases while the speed decreases. window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: 'local'};

That is, it is an orbit where the right ascension of the ascending node changes at the same rate as the Sun moves relative to the Earth. Sun-synchronous orbits are often highly relevant an useful for optical Earth observation satellites that desire to have consistent illumination conditions. A Sun-synchronous orbit is guaranteed to cross the equator at the same local time (e.g. 2pm) at each crossing event. Due to Earth's oblateness known as the \\(J_2\\) zonal harmonic, frequently referred as simply \\(J_2\\) , there is a constant, secular drift of the right ascension of all Earth orbiting objects. Since the \\(J_2\\) harmonic is the second largest after that of point-mass gravity, it is a dominant effect on the orbit \\[ \\dot{\\Omega} = -\\frac{3nR^2_EJ_2}{2a^2(1-e^2)^2} \\] when combined with the required nodal precession rate for sun synchronicity \\[ \\dot{\\Omega} = \\frac{360 \\; \\text{deg}}{1 \\; \\text{year}}\\frac{1 \\; \\text{year}}{365.2421897 \\; \\text{day}} = 0.98564736 \\frac{\\text{deg}}{\\text{day}} \\] can be rearranged to solve for the inclination as a function of semi-major axis and eccentricity \\[ i = \\arccos{\\Big(-\\frac{2a^{\\frac{7}{2}}\\dot{\\Omega}_{ss}(1-e^2)^2}{3R^2_EJ_2\\sqrt{\\mu}}\\Big)} \\] The function sun_syncrhonous_inclination calculates this inclination. The figure below shows how the inclination required to maintain a sun-synchronous orbit varies with altitude. Rocket launches to Sun-synchronous orbits will commonly have a fixed altitude (around 500 to 1000 kilometers for many Earth observation missions) and zero eccentricity. The launch provider will select the inclination the rocket is then determined by the above equation to provide the desired effect. window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: 'local'};

The periapsis will be the point of the closest approach as well as the point of greatest speed throughout the orbit. Info The word periapsis is formed by combination of the Greek words \" peri- \", meaning around, about and \" apsis \" meaning \"arch or vault\". An apsis is the farthest or nearest point in the orbit of a planetary body about its primary body. Thereforce periapsis of an orbit is the point of closest approach of the orbiting body with respect to its central body. The suffix can be modified to indicate the point of closest approach to a specific celestical body. The perigee is the point of cloest approach to an object orbiting Earth. The perihelion is the point of closest approach to the Sun. The periapsis velocity is given by periapsis_velocity or, for an Earth-orbiting object, the function perigee_velocity can be used. perigee_velocity simplified the call by supplying the gravitational parameter of Earth to the function call. Periapsis velocity is calculated by $$ v_{p} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{a}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1+e}{1-e}} $$ where \\(\\mu\\) is the gravitational constant of the central body, \\(a\\) is the semi-major axis of the orbit, and \\(e\\) is the eccentricity.

That is, it is an orbit where the right ascension of the ascending node changes at the same rate as the Sun moves relative to the Earth. Sun-synchronous orbits are often highly relevant an useful for optical Earth observation satellites that desire to have consistent illumination conditions. A Sun-synchronous orbit is guaranteed to cross the equator at the same local time (e.g. 2pm) at each crossing event. Due to Earth's oblateness known as the \\(J_2\\) zonal harmonic, frequently referred as simply \\(J_2\\) , there is a constant, secular drift of the right ascension of all Earth orbiting objects. Since the \\(J_2\\) harmonic is the second largest after that of point-mass gravity, it is a dominant effect on the orbit \\[ \\dot{\\Omega} = -\\frac{3nR^2_EJ_2}{2a^2(1-e^2)^2} \\] when combined with the required nodal precession rate for sun synchronicity \\[ \\dot{\\Omega} = \\frac{360 \\; \\text{deg}}{1 \\; \\text{year}}\\frac{1 \\; \\text{year}}{365.2421897 \\; \\text{day}} = 0.98564736 \\frac{\\text{deg}}{\\text{day}} \\] can be rearranged to solve for the inclination as a function of semi-major axis and eccentricity \\[ i = \\arccos{\\Big(-\\frac{2a^{\\frac{7}{2}}\\dot{\\Omega}_{ss}(1-e^2)^2}{3R^2_EJ_2\\sqrt{\\mu}}\\Big)} \\] The function sun_syncrhonous_inclination calculates this inclination. The figure below shows how the inclination required to maintain a sun-synchronous orbit varies with altitude. Rocket launches to Sun-synchronous orbits will commonly have a fixed altitude (around 500 to 1000 kilometers for many Earth observation missions) and zero eccentricity.

The package makes the distinction between the representation of a specific time and the conversion between different time scales. Precise specification of an instant in time requires the specification of both a time representation and time scale. Time Representation \u00b6 A single instance in time can be represented in multiple different formats. For examples The J2000 Epoch can be represented as a calendar date in terms of years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds as 2000-01-01T12:00:00 . The same instant can also be represented in terms of Modified Julian Days as 51544.5 . Both of these representations refer to the same instant in time. Time Scales \u00b6 In addition to representing time in different manners, there are also different time scales. A time scale is a standard to reckoning and resolving instances in time. Multimple time scales have been introduced due to the criticality of being able to correctly measure and understand when specific events occur in science and engineering. Within a time scale it is possible to compare different instances in time to determine if one is before, after, or at the same time as another instant. It is also possible to compare between time scales, however you must know how to properly convert between them. It is assumed that all time scales use the same definition of the SI second, and therefore advance at the same rate. Note Athough the calendar date representations of time 2000-01-01T12:00:00 UTC and 2000-01-01T12:00:00 GPS have the same values, they are actually different instances in time! . This is because while the calendar date representations are the same there are actually offsets between the different time scales. The time scales currently supported by RAstro are listed below: Time Scale Description GPS GPS stands for Global Positioning System time. It is specifically, the time scale used by the US GPS satellites. It is different from TAI and TT by constant, fixed offsets. TAI TAI is a French acronym for temps atomique international . It is an atomic time scale meant to track the proper time on the Earth's surface. UTC UTC stands for Universal Coordinated Time. UTC tracks the solar day, accounting for long term variations due to changes in Earth's rotation to within +/- 1 second. Tracking the solar day in this manner introduces an offset between TAI and UTC of a fixed number of leap seconds. UT1 UT1 stands for Universal Time 1. UT1 represents the time as determined by the true solar day. Due to Earth's rotation rate constantly changing UT1 itself is constantly changing. The difference between UT1 and UTC is empirically estimated on a daily basis as an Earth orientation parameter. TT TT is Terrestrial Time, a time scale used historically to model the motion of planets and other solar system bodies. These models are still in wide use.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"user_guide/time/#intro","text":"The time module provides functions for the handling of time.
