Rastro is a modern, fast (high-performance), astrodynamics library for research and engineering.

The key features are:
- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with C++ libraries, thanks to core library being written in rust.
- **Fast to code**: Rastro provides a Python 3.6+ wrapper that is auto-generated from the core rust libraries. Making it easy to use rastro without recompiling.
- **Intuitive**: API designed to be composable, making it easy to build on core concepts.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs, more time building.

This documentation focuses on how to get started, how to use the library, and examples of using rastro to solve different problems. This documentation focuses on the Python interface to rastro since the Rust interface is documented as part of the crate build process.
