# Intro

The study of the motion of planets and other celestial bodies is one of the 
oldest sciences known to man. Ancient Mayan astronomers discovered an 18.7 
-year cycle in lunar motion and studied the skies to predict eclipses. This 
reference section provides a deeper discussion of the study, analysis, and 
properties of orbital trajectories.
