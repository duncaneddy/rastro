# The Two-Body Problem

The two-body problem is the simplest dynamical scenario analyzed in
astrodynamics. The two-body is the problem of predicting the motion of to
gravitationally-attracting massive objects that are viewed as point-masses
when no other forces or objects are present. The most common case of the 
two-body problem is that where one object is significantly more massive than 
the other such that the force of the larger object on the smaller dominates 
the scenario. This case occurs for planets orbiting around the Sun, as 
well as for satellites orbiting around Earth or other bodies in the solar 
system.

## Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

[Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler) 
first published his laws of planetary motion Between 1609 and 1619. Although, Kepler derived his 
laws from empirical observations of the motion of the planets around the Sun, their 
validity can be proven from analysis of the two-body problem. Analysis of the 
two-body problem provides useful insight into the motion of objects in space.
