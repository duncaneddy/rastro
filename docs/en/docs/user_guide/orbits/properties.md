# Orbital Properties

The `orbits` module also provides functions to help derive useful parameters
from the orbital trajectory.

## Periapsis Properties

There are a few properties of an orbit that can be derived from 

For convenience, `perigee_*` functions are provided which wrap the general 
periapsis functions and specifically pass the `GM_EARTH` constants so that 
it does not need to be done by the user.

## Apoapsis Properties

## Mean Motion

## Orbital Period

## Sun-Synchronous Inclination
