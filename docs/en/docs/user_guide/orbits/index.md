# Intro

The `orbits` submodule provides functions for the analysis of satellite orbits 
and their properties. The functions of this module frequently represent 
common fundamental astrodynamics concepts to gain useful insight
into a trajectory's properties.


This section assumes basic knowledge of orbital trajectories, their 
representation, and related concepts. See the [Orbit's reference section](../../reference/orbits/index.md) 
for a more thorough introduction and discussion of the associated concepts.
