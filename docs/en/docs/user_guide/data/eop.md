# Earth Orientation Data

The `eop` module provides data structures and functions for the updating, 
loading, and use of Earth orientation parameter (EOP) data.

Earth Orientation Parameters are empirically observed and estimated 
parameters that describe the irregularities in Earth's rotation in space. 
When combined with their specific related models they provide the mechanism 
to transform between an Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) reference frame 
and an inertial reference frame.
